# Foodie by JAD

## Description
This repository contains the solution for Project 1.

## Project description

For this project we built a dynamic web interface which allows users to create a weekly food plan based on their selection of cuisine type. This application also generates fun food facts from a server-side api.

In order for our work to show what we can do, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Server Side APIs.

## APIs used:
https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs

https://humorapi.com/

We registered for API keys from the above sources, in order receive responses from our specific endpoints.

## Subsequently, we are able to say that the following User Story met its Acceptance Criteria (A/C):

User Story:

As a user interested in meal planning and discovering new recipes, I want to search for recipes based on ingredients or dietary preferences, So that I can plan weekly meals efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria (A/C):

Scenario 1: Searching for Recipes

- Given I am on the home screen of the application,

- When I click on different cuisine options,

- Then, I am then redirected to corresponding recipe cards

Scenario 2: Adding Recipes to the Calendar

- Given I have searched for a recipe,

- When I find a recipe I like,

- Then I can add it to a specific day in the interactive weekly calendar.

Scenario 3: Viewing Fun Food

- Given the fun food fact feature,

- When I click on the button,

- Then I see a new fun food item or something humorous like food jokes or memes

## Non-Committed, Additional Details:
- The application should support filtering recipes by dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).

- Each recipe displayed should include key details such as ingredients, cooking time, and instructions.

- Fun facts should be engaging and relevant to the userâ€™s interests (e.g., nutrition, culinary history).

## Notes:
- Integration with a database of recipes and daily fun facts is required

- The calendar should allow users to easily navigate between days

- Mobile responsiveness and intuitive user interface design are crucial for ease of use

We also used these sites for code and other material, like data requests and responses, data retrieval, styling, and other things like pictures:

Our Team referenced code (HTML and CSS) from the UT provided lessons, however, we wrote all changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of the webpage, html, styles, and scripts.

We commented and committed to our repo heavily and have been able to deploy without issue, once all files/urls were properly referenced, linked, and landed in the appropriate places.
